High-Level Services and Data-Flow for Online Connect Four:

- player list (like a directory or bookkeeper)
	* list of users online 
	* and their status (busy, away, active)
	
- playing board
	* contains 7x6 matrix/grid of unfilled circles
	* must keep track of different coloured chips that are dropped (player chips)
	* chips must be placed into the lowest available circle (bottom or on top of another chip)
	* must recognize 4 chips of the same colour horizontally, vertically or diagonally
	
- opponent pairing (kind of like an MC or announcer)
	* randomly chooses opponent for you from the list of people that are online
	* determines whose turn it is to play
	* determines the winner/loser
